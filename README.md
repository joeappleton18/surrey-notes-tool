# Surrey Notes Tool

This tool is designed to convert markdown to self-contained HTMl files. 

Each document is converted to a single HTML file and can be uploaded to to a learning management system (LMS) such as SurreyLearn.

## Usage


First, in root of your project create a folder called `templates` and add a `template.html` file. This file will be used to generate the HTML files. [For now, it's best to use the provided `template.html` file](https://github.com/joeappleton18/surrey-notes-tool/blob/master/template/template.html).
